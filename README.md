# Graph_Search_Algo_Comparisons
N-puzzle is a well-known problem used for a long time by Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers
as a benchmark for comparing the performance of search algorithms. In this project, we have implemented
various classical search algorithms for solving the n-puzzle problem. It
also entails performance analysis of these algorithms. The algorithms are: breadth first search
(BFS), uniform cost search (UCS), depth limited search (DLS), iterative deepening depth first
search (IDS), greedy best first search (GBFS), and A* search.
